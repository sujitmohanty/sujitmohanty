## Hi there 👋

🌐 I am a **former Front-end Engineer**.

Around the mid of 2018, I made the descision of pursuing a disjointed technology stack with incosistent tooling, frequent disruptions ,and an overabundance of self-nominated experts.

I would (pointlessly) try my best to stay abreast with the latest way of doing things and persevere through the chaos, rather than focusing on the core computing or software development fundamentals. Two scathing job losses, prolonged joblessness pushed me to a state of profound abhorrence for this profile, tech stack and made me second-guess my ability to thrive as a Software Engineer in the foreseeable future.

In 2024, I came to the realisation that re-committing to persist in this cancerous path of JavaScript framework driven web development would be outright detrimental for my sanity and imprudent for my career. I nuked all my previous work as a precursor to start things from scratch.

As of 2025, I am an advocate for technology stacks that are battle-tested, strongly opinionated, boast a large and active community, come with batteries-included and follow a convention over configuration philospohy for development.
