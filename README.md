## Hi there 👋

🌐 I am a **former Front-end Engineer** specialising in React.js

Around the mid of 2018, I made the descision of pursuing a disjointed technology stack with incosistent tooling, frequent disruptions and an overabundance of self-nominated experts.

I would (pointlessly) try my best to stay abreast with the latest way of doing things and persevere through the chaos, rather than focusing on the core computing or software development fundamentals. Two scathing job losses and a period of prolonged joblessness pushed me into a state of profound abhorrence and made me second-guess my ability to thrive as a Software Engineer in the foreseeable future.

In 2024, I came to the realisation that strictly re-committing to persist in this cancerous path of JavaScript framework driven web development would be outright detrimental for my sanity and imprudent for my career. Following this decision, I nuked all my previous work as a precursor ina bid to start things from scratch and build my profile up again.

As of 2025, I am an advocate for technology stacks that are battle-tested, strongly opinionated, come with batteries-included and follow a convention over configuration philospohy for development.
