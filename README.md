## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Masterâ€™s student in Software Engineering in Germany, working across the full stack â€” from **React UIs** to **backend APIs** and **cloud-native deployments**.  
My focus is on building **end-to-end applications** that are secure, scalable, and production-ready, with pipelines and infrastructure that follow **industry best practices**.

- ðŸ”§ Projects include a full-featured Blog API (TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, JWT, Docker) and full-stack apps with React.
