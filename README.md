I am an advocate for technologies that are strongly opinionated, come with batteries-included and follow a convention over configuration philospohy for development.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Back in 2012, I was so obsessed with a debutant Hindi TV Soap Opera actress that I composed and published a wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sujitmohanty2012) for her.
